    "# Student Jobsheet Usage Guide\n",
    "This jobsheet will be used to carry out the Basic Programming Practicum at the State Polytechnic of Malang, Information Technology Department. The main component of this jobsheet is to use `Java Shell tool (JSheel)`, so it will be very easy\n",
    "to learn more interactive programming without installing additional tools or editors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Access Jobsheet\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2 modes or views that can be used, namely classic mode (simple) and lab mode. Classic mode is synonymous with\n",
    "simplicity of the appearance of the editor, but the essence of the tool to run program code can still be done. The opposite of\n",
    "lab mode, like a tool for the lab with the complexity of the settings in it up to\n",
    "editor view. Here are the views of the two modes\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/mode-classic.png)\n",
    "> User Interface Classic mode\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/mode-lab.png)\n",
    "> Lab Mode User Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps you can take to use this jobsheet are as follows\n",
    "+ Please click the link [classic mode](https://s.id/binder-classic) to select the classic view, while clicking\n",
    "link [lab mode](https://s.id/binder-lab) for lab mode display.\n",
    "+ After clicking the link using either classic mode or lab mode, a loading screen will appear as shown in the following image\n",
    "\n",
    "    ![](images/loading-lab.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Please wait a while until the display appears whether using classic mode or lab mode, select the `jobsheet` . folder\n",
    "as desired. For example jobsheet 5 or week 5 means that the selected folder is `05`. After\n",
    "selecting the folder will enter the directory as shown in the following image\n",
    "\n",
    "  ![](images/01.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Reselect the file with the extension `.ipynb` as in the image below,\n",
    "\n",
    "  ![](images/02.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "  Then it will open a new tab, with the jobsheet view or editor ready to use. It looks like the following picture\n",
    "\n",
    "  ![](images/03.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "  From the picture above there are two modes, namely `Markdown and Code`. `Markdown` means contains description of the jobsheet or steps\n",
    "  which must be done. Then for the `Code` mode, it contains program code that can be run directly. Here's the visualization\n",
    "of the two modes.\n",
    "\n",
    "  > `Markdown and Code` are often referred to as `Cell`, in fact apart from these two there are other types but\n",
    "  > frequently used are `Markdown and Code.`\n",
    "\n",
    "  ![](images/04.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "  When clicked on `Code` mode then the top circled in red will change to `Code` mode, when\n",
    "has changed to `Code` mode can click the `Run` button to run. For more details, see the illustration in\n",
    "below\n",
    "\n",
    "  ![](images/05.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "  > Every `Cell`, whether it is `Code or Markdown` type, can be executed with the Run button or with a combination\n",
    "  > `CTRL + Enter` key. When we want to change the value or content contained in `Cell`, we can do this by\n",
    "  > `double click`, then when we want to add `Cell` below or above it can be found from the menu\n",
    "  > `Insert - Insert Cell Above (insert above current Cell) or vice versa Insert Cell Bellow (below current Cell)`\n",
    "  >\n",
    "  > **Important Notes!**\n",
    "  + Markdown is a lightweight markup language for formatting documents, for more details and how to use them\n",
    "  can be seen at the link [below](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/)\n",
    "  + The editor you are using is on a public server that has a certain session length, so that when it time out\n",
    "  then have to repeat from the beginning for the process of using this jobsheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Troubleshooting\n",
    "There are several things or cases that often occur when using this online jobsheet such as\n",
    "+ When running the code but no output appears, if this happens then what needs to be done is to restart the kernel as shown in the following picture\n",
    "  + Click Save until a checkpoint appears as shown in the following image\n",
    "\n",
    "    ![](images/09.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "  + Reopen the jobsheet file as shown below\n",
    "\n",
    "    ![](images/10.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Session has run out or has been idle for too long, resulting in program code or anything that has been typed will be lost, the steps that can be taken are to repeat from the beginning or click the link for this jobsheet. The session that has been exhausted is shown in the image below\n",
    "\n",

    "## Assignment Collection*\n",
    "\n",
    "For the task model according to the agreement and what each lecturer looks like, the following is an example of collecting assignments\n",
    "using github.\n",
    "\n",
    "> To use github, students must first register at [github.com](https://github.com/) and\n",
    "> install a git client, for example [git desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). Should\n",
    "> for the registration process, use the institutional email (xxxx@polinema.ac.id) to get a benefit offer from github.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> When you want to type Markdown please use the editor that you think is easiest like [Vs Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) or editor\n",
    "> online like [stackedit.io](https://stackedit.io/app#).\n",
    "\n",
    "The following steps can be used to perform task collection;\n",
    "+ Please open the assignment collection point on github, the address will be informed by the respective lecturers. As an example\n",
    "the collection address has been given, then click the `Fork` button in the upper right corner as shown below\n",
    "\n",
    "    ![](images/06.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "+ If you have added content or the contents of your report according to the guidelines, Push and Pull requests to collect using\n",
    "the git client tool you have installed\n",
    "+ The results will appear in the telegram group as in the following example\n",
    "\n",
